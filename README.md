# Segmenting and Clustering Neighborhoods in Toronto
In this project, we will  explore, segment, and cluster the neighborhoods in the city of Toronto. The neighborhood data is not readily available on the internet. What is interesting about the field of data science is that each project can be challenging in its unique way, so for the Toronto neighborhood data, a Wikipedia page exists that has all the information we need to explore and cluster the neighborhoods in Toronto. we will be required to scrape the Wikipedia page and wrangle the data, clean it, and then read it into a pandas  dataframe so that it is in a structured format.

Once the data is in a structured format, we can explore and cluster the neighborhoods in the city of Toronto.
