# Segmenting and Clustering Neighborhoods in Toronto
In this project, we will explore, segment, and cluster the neighborhoods in the city of Toronto. What is interesting about the field of data science is that each project can be challenging in finding the required data. For the Toronto neighborhood data, a Wikipedia page exists that has all the information we need to explore and cluster the neighborhoods in Toronto. we have to scrape the Wikipedia page and wrangle the data, clean it, and then read it into a pandas dataframe so that it is in a structured format.

Once the data is in a structured format, we can explore and cluster the neighborhoods in the city of Toronto.
